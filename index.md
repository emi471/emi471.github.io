## Final Project
For the final data analysis project, the WA State EV population and infrastructure (EV chargers) were evaluated for a possible correlation with landmark EV legsislation. If there was a positive correlation, then landmark legsislation would directly correlate with an increase in the growth rates of EV production and expansion of EV infrastructure.

## Data Sources and Project Ideas
Here are five data sources I'm considering:

1.  **[NYC Citi Bike Trips](https://citibikenyc.com/system-data)**
    * **Description:** This dataset includes every single Citi Bike ride taken in NYC, updated monthly. For each trip, the start/end station and start/end time is included, as well as duration and basic user info.
    * **Idea:** I could analyze ride patterns to find the top 10 busiest commuter routes in NYC, and create a map visualization showing the routes. I can also use the additional data the dataset provides about each trip to find the busiest hours and days of the week.

2.  **[Netflix Movies and TV Shows](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows)**
    * **Description:** This is a dataset of all the movies and TV shows on Netflix. Includes the title, director, cast, release year, rating, and genre.
    * **Idea:** It would be interesting to see how Netflix's content library has changed over the years. I would want to create a multi-line graph to analyze the popularity of each genre over time by measuring how many movies/shows in that genre are added to the library.

3.  **[WA Electric Vehicle (EV) Population](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data)**
    * **Description:** This dataset is from the Washington Department of Licensing and lists all registered EVs in Washington. It includes the car's make, model, year, and county/city its registered in.
    * **Idea:** I could create a bar chart showing the most popular EV models. A more difficult but interesting idea would be to create a geo-scatter plot showing the counties/cities with the most EVs, and each bubble could show the information about that EV like its make/model.

4.  **[World Happiness Report](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ajaypalsinghlo/world-happiness-report-2021)**
    * **Description:** This dataset ranks countries by their happiness score, and includes the data used to calculate that score. This is similar to data we explored at the beginning of the semester.
    * **Idea:** A simple idea would be to create a scatter plot that answers the question "does money buy happiness?"
  
5.  **[FBI Crime Data](https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#/pages/downloads)**
    * **Description:** This dataset allows you to explore crime incident-based data by state, updated since August 5, 2025.
    * **Idea:** I think a geo-scatter plot to visualize all the crime in Washington state would be cool. Color-coding them by type of crime or affiliated agency would make the visualization more interesting.
